    <h2>Automated GEN Testing</h2>
    <div style="padding-left:5%">
        <p>These tests check the number of trees produced by GEN at 3 terminal nodes as well as which trees are produced.</p>
        <p>There are also tests for the SPOT functions "GENwithCliticMovement" which reorders one clitic, and "GENwithPermutation," which reorders all terminals.</p>
        <p>Keeping the terminal and intermediate categories constant, the phonological tree candidate sets produced by SPOT’s core GEN function for n words are determined by five main parameters.  These parameters are as follows:</p>
        <h3>GEN parameters in SPOT:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Root tree in a phonological phrase (φ) 
                <ul>
                    <li>[+φ root] = {requireRecWrapper:true}: Prosodic trees are rooted in phonological phrases.</li>
                    <li>[–φ root]: Prosodic trees are rooted in intonational phrases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Non-Recursivity:
                <ul>
                    <li>[+NonRec] = {obeysNonrecursivity:true}: All children of a node of category K must be of category &lt; K.</li>
                    <li>[–NonRec]: All children of a node of category K must be of category ≤ K. That is, nodes of category K may dominate other nodes of category K.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Intermediate Branching:
            <ul>
                <li>[+Branching] = {noUnary:true}: Every non-root, non-terminal node (i.e., every φ) will have at least two children. No intermediate nodes will be unary.</li>
                <li>[–Branching]: Some intermediate nodes (namely, minimal φs) may be unary.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>No Level Skipping (Exhaustivity):
                <ul>
                    <li>[+Exh] = {obeysExhaustivity:true}: Every non-root node of level K is dominated by a node of level K or K+1.</li>
                    <li>[–Exh]: Non-root nodes of level K may be dominated by nodes of any level ≥ K. </li>
                </ul>            
            
            <li>Headedness:
                <ul>
                    <li>[+Hd] = {obeysHeadedness:true}: Every non-terminal node of level K immediately dominates at least one node of level K–1.</li>
                    <li>[–Hd]: It is possible for a non-terminal node of level K to dominate only nodes of level ≤ K–2. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
